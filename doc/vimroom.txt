I do most of my writing in Vim, because I’m a big nerd. It does most of what
I want a writing environment to do, but I miss some of the “distraction free"
features of the quite exceptional WriteRoom. Fullscreening Vim means that text
ends up flat up against the left side of my monitor, but I’d much prefer it to
be centered. I’d also like a little of the visual clutter to fade away.  Some
of this is possible with MacVim, but I’d rather do as much as possible in
a platform-independent way. So, command-line Vim it is.

INSTALLATION                                              *vimroom-installation*

I think the best way to install Vim plugins is via Tim Pope’s Pathogen. Using
that plugin, you can simply clone the VimRoom repository into your bundles
directory, and you’re done.

Without Pathogen, installation is almost as trivial: simply copy
./plugins/vimroom.vim from the repository into your plugins directory. That’s
it!

CONFIGURATION                                            *vimroom-configuration*

By default, VimRoom binds <Leader>V to <Plug>VimroomToggle, and sets up an 80
column workspace with at least 5 columns of space on either side (it doesn’t
help at all to have single-column sidebars, you see), and 3 lines of space
above and below. It assumes a black background when hiding visual
distractions. As of v0.4, VimRoom also sets up a :VimroomToggle command that
has the same effect.

Changing any of these assumptions is a simple matter of setting variables in
your .vimrc.

                                                        *g:vimroom_background*
is the background color to be used for hiding elements.  Set this to your
terminal’s background color (“white”, “black”, etc.)

                                                 *g:vimroom_min_sidebar_width*
is the minimum sidebar width. This will automatically expand to take up all
the free space left after setting the main workspace window to g:vimroom_width
pcolumns.

                                                 *g:vimroom_navigational_keys*
determines whether Vimroom will map keys like <Up>, <Down>, j, and k to
navigate over “display” lines, rather than “logical” lines. This defaults to
p1 (on), if you’d prefer the mapping not take place, set it to 0 (off).

                                                         *g:vimroom_scrolloff*
specifies how many lines of text ought appear before and after the cursor.
pThis defaults to 999, which centers the cursor on the screen.

                                                    *g:vimroom_sidebar_height*
sets the height of the upper and lower “sidebars.” If you don’t want vertical
padding, set this to 0.

                                                             *g:vimroom_width*
is the width of your workspace.


You can bind the <Plug>VimroomToggle function to any key combination you like
via the usual mechanisms. For example::
>
  nnoremap <silent> <Leader>mz <Plug>VimroomToggle
<>

Would bind the function to <Leader>mz. Trivial, right?

And that’s it!
